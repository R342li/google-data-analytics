Overview of the project

This case study is a capstone project of the Google Data Analytics course offered by Coursera. The goal of this project is to derive actionable insights to convert casual riders of the fictional Cyclistic Bike-Share company into annual members and provide other recommendations for the improvements of current business models. While considering the business inquiries and characteristics of data, I used R to clean and prepare the database and specially used the functions ggplot for some basic analysis. Then, I move the database to Tableau for visualisation.
